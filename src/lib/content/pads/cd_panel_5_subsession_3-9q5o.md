Title: Digital Selfcare tools and utilities



Digital issues:

·      Amount of possibilities/ volume of information can be overwhelming

·      Influences on attention span

·      Addiction to social media

The struggle of missing information: it is difficult to filter out important information among all the noise (in internet/ social media/ etc.)



A project by Jennifer Rabe:

    "Twinkle": The idea is to provide different personas individuals can identify with and get help and information accordingly! Moreover, there could be Apps that help people declutter for example their smartphones. 

    Another part is the communication of information about e.g. cookies, security and privacy in the digital space.
