### Registration

Registration is free of charge. Upon registration you will receive a link to access the conference virtual space. Additionally, we will send you a small gift per postal mail as a souvenir.

Please register online [here](https://www.infoclio.ch/en/unconference-digital-critique-information-list-liste-dinformations-informationsliste).

### Pitching and voting procedures

On the first day of the event (21st of October, 10:00) we will have a pitching session. If you come up with an idea, just raise your hand and we will call you up, so you can explain your idea. Make sure to have a title for your panel at hand. If you already pitched your idea online: great, we will call you up and you can elaborate if you wish.

An unconference is an open space. Every topic is worth considering and discussing. From data management, funding, and privacy to digital methods and tools: everything is welcome.

You don’t know if people want to discuss this? Pitch it! Are you unsure if the topic belongs to ‘digital criticism’? Pitch it!

Once we've collected all panel propositions, those will be submitted to a majority vote by all participants. Panels who get more consent will be integrated to the conference programme as panel slots of 45 min. More information about the voting system are to be found [here](https://mieuxvoter.fr/index.php/decouvrir/?lang=en).

The definitive programme will then be published on this website. Participants are then free to move among the various virtual rooms and attend the panels they are interested in.

### Panels

Panels are 45-minute discussion and exchange sessions on a given theme. The person who proposed the theme moderates the discussions.

### Language(S!)

As we are in Switzerland, a country with four official languages, we are committed to promote plurilingualism. We’re keen to use English throughout the conference as lingua franca, but will also encourage participants to speak their own languages.

- Keynotes will be in French (with live subtitles in English) and English.
- Plenary communication will be in English, but in the pitching session people may feel free to speak in their own language and we’ll translate live for those who don’t understand.
- In the panels, the language mix can vary. Panel moderators should decide how they want to deal with it according to the participants.

## FAQ

No. As an unconference, Digital Criticism does not need to follow a traditional scientific event, but rather works as an open space where the presenters, organizers and participants choose the topics. It’s a collaborative way to debate, share information and build knowledge.

<summary>Content and Structure</summary>

The content and structure of the day are driven by the participants. See for instance the concept of [BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp). We follow the four flow principles:

- Whoever comes are the right people
- Whatever happens, is the only thing that could have
- Whenever it starts is the right time
- When it's over, it's over
