Title: Moritz MÃ¤hr: Micropublications (secure research data, do something participant driven, new ways for preprints)

What are micropublications?

- (Short) text(s), source(s), collection(s)
- Hypertextual (or even linked data)
- URI (URL, DOI, ARK)

Examples

- [https://cache.ch/](https://cache.ch/)

Gabi

- Securing research data

Ina

- What to report?

Wendelin

- The act of publishing (the meaning)
- Finalising thoughts by publishing

Victoria Fleury

- Repositories

Open Questions/Topics:

- What is research data? What to report?

* Which steps do you take (method)

* Documenting everything? Does it help to grasp the essence? Culture of your discipline!?

  - Status -> temporary, intermediate or final (and who has the authority)

* Blogging is more accessible

* Half of the professionals get the concept (writing papers instead) > Blog turned into a journal?

* Temporary status has a value of its own (3 reasons to have a blog that disappears afterwards: collaboration, marking territory, influencing)

* Publications as products and not only as data

  - Repositories

* [https://mhistories.hypotheses.org/](https://mhistories.hypotheses.org/)

* Low entry barrier infrastructures for authors

* (Collaborative) annotations like [https://web.hypothes.is/](https://web.hypothes.is/)

What we wish for:

Gabi: More flexibility, more acceptance

Ina: Infrastructure for student writing and temporary writing (but it needs to be maintained)

Victoria: Hybrid and more freedom

Wendelin: Where does valuation take place? > more critical stance against instiutions, publishing houses
