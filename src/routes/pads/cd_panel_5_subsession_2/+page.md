Title: How much advertising DH research while doing it? (Isabelle Marthot-Santaniello)

Introduction from Isabelle:

- Rythm: research in the area moves so fast, we can't wait 3 years to the official publication.
- collaboration: DH implies collaboration. What does it imply in amount of time investment
- Open to wide Audience: when do we open our research? how long we wait before going public?
- Showcases with intermediary results or database.
- Publications vs other forms of "reputation"
- Sustainability

Means and Media:

- setting up a website
- plethora of social media outlets (and oldschool mailing lists).
- Weighting traditional and novel formats of Workshops and Conferences.
- Monographs and papers as the gold standard in evaluation

How does reputation of DH projects work within SNF/other areas of interest?

- Isa: (intermediate) reports are open to activities etc. but grant applications
- Moritz: several currencies (job applications vs grant applications)
