**Title:** Combining information from diverse collections and sources â€“ accessing visualization

By Victoria Fleury

    How often were artworks reproduced during Monets lifetime?

    Quantitative analysis:

- While later paintings (like the water lilly paintings) were only rarely reproduced, Monets earlier work (ex. "Camille or the woman with a green dress") was reproduced more often --> Artworks painted in the beginnings of monets career were more often reproduced; this is surprising because he is more famous for his later works today!
- Issues with quantitative analysis: biased databases, translations from objects to database to visualizations

  9 participants were present at the discussion

Problem: Sample could be biased! (what is being digitized, and what isn't) - mostly western, european art --> Interesting article by Ian Milligan, a Canadian historian: [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/527016](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/527016)

For western researchers it is difficult to look at archives for example in Japan, because you might have problems to understand the language \& the use of a different metadata

Victoria Fleury only looked at metadata, it would be interesting to utilize an image recognition technique --> and find replicas of paintings through that.

Are there any metadata standards in art history? NO!

--> A good archive that Vicoria Fleury used in her research: [https://prometheus-bildarchiv.de/en/prometheus/index](https://prometheus-bildarchiv.de/en/prometheus/index)

There is a problem when it comes to metadata:

    Either each community has their own standard, and it is too specific to apply it to other researches OR as a researcher you could use the standards of big initiatives (but they are often too broad, and not specific enough) --> There is no middle-ground!!
