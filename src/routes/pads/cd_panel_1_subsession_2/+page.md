Important concepts:

    1. Critical digital literacy actually is based on the concept of critical pedagogy of Paulo Freire. This very concept of critical digital pedagogy actually informs the whole process of critical information literacy.

    3. So the whole process of critical digital literacy is a self-reflexive process that is ultimately aimed at creation of a democratic and participatory scholarly communication process.
